# Tetris Bot
I coded a Tetris auto-player using Python and Pygame as part of a university coursework. The bot uses AI heuristics which have been tweaked to provide optimal performance. Heuristics considered by the auto-player are aggregate height, number of holes, bumpiness, number of filled rows and the maximum height of the blocks. 

The auto-player plays in an aggressive manner for the lower half of the board by trying to clear more rows at one go and settles down to a more defensive player once the maximum height exceeds the half board mark. 

The game was designed by a UCL Professor but the "player.py" file was coded by me.
